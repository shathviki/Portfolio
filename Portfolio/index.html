                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, it's lovely to meet you!👋🏼 I’m Shathviki, an 12th grade student at Bur Oak Secondary School and aspiring engineer! I am interested in all things software related and am currently knowledgeable in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. My other interests lie in retail and sales, music, social activism, anti-trafficking awareness, and project management. </p>
            
                <p><i><b>How'd I end up here? </i></b>Well, it all started with my passion for music and activism. These two seemingly separate paths led me to pursue engineering and discover how my journey through high school shaped my interests. I used to believe that activism and STEM were isolated fields, but along the way, I realized there are so many intersections between them. And, music equipped me with all the skills to work in both these fields - like dedication, resilience, and creativity. Now, my goal is to show others that you can combine both interests, and no matter what we do in life, there is always room for compassion and helping each other out. My dream is to work on groundbreaking technology that detects human trafficking patterns, aiming to help put an end to this pressing issue. By leveraging my engineering skills and merging them with my dedication to social activism, I hope to make a meaningful impact and contribute to a world where everyone can live without fear and in freedom.</p>

                    <br>
                    <li><b>Piano🎹:</b> I started playing the piano since I was 7! Playing western music challenges and contrasts what I learned though Sangeetham, yet I love to push myself musically.
